## What is an MWB file?
Database document created by MySQL Workbench, a graphical interface used for creating and administering MySQL databases; saves a database design, called an EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) model; defines tables, views, routines, privileges, and other constructs for a database.

### More Information
MWB files are used for saving the working progress of a database while it is being developed. Once the EER model is complete, MySQL Workbench can generate a MySQL database from the MWB file.
